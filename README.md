# PigDice
My implementation of the Pig Dice game from The C# Player's Guide 3rd Edition.
The official solution can be found here: http://starboundsoftware.com/books/c-sharp/try-it-out/pig-dice

Pig Dice is a game played between two player with two 6 sided dice.
On each player's turn, they have two actions they can take: 
1. Roll the dice and add the total of the two dice to a rolling total.
2. End their turn and bank the points they've accumulated that turn.

Players may roll the dice as many times as they wish on their turn. 
If either die comes up as a 1, the turn ends immediately and no points are banked.

The first player to successfully bank 100 or more points wins.
